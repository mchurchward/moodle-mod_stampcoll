  <p>By default, the module allows a teacher to give "stamps" (i.e. picture
  with a comment) to students so they collect these stamps. The activity can
  be used in many ways, such as motivative bonus marks, absence marks,
  certification records etc.</p> 
  
  <p>The module uses capabilities to declare who can e.g. collect stamps or
  give stamps. Therefore, student can be allowed to give stamps to other
  students, the stamps may be given to teachers etc.  Teachers can setup the
  module to show all stamps to all students, to show stamps only to the
  individual student to whom it was awarded or to hide stamps completely.</p>
